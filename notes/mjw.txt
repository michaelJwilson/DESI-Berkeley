-- QSOs 'blow a hole' in the ELG selection; how big?
   -- Separate angular mask for ELGs, LRGs, QSOs. 

03/05/2018
-- DESI focal plane has a radius of 407 mm corresponding to 1.605 deg on the sky;  The enclosed area is 8.09 sq. deg
-- IN DESI:  TILING covered all 4 pi;
-- /desimodel/data/footprint/
-- Footprint:  https://desi.lbl.gov/trac/browser/code/desimodel/trunk/data/footprint

--  TARGETID from BRICKID .25 x .25 and BRICK_OBJID; 
--  What is the exact radius of a tile (pointing) in radians.
--  What are the allowed dtypes, e.g. np.int32; numpy defaults.  
--  Difference between DESITARGET and TARGET_ID; targetmask.yaml; each bit is true/false for why target could have been selected. 
--  Healpy with openmp (for large nside); 
--  Astropy.healpy contains cone_search.py, contained in current directory.
--  To get the fractional area of a tile in a given pixel: 
      -- oversample the healpy map with nside
      -- find all pixels that fall in a given tile
      -- map these back to the pixels of the original imap.
      -- Calculate fractional area that came from each tile.

--  mags pdf assumed that doesn't know about redshift -> ** no scaling of flux with redshift ** -> needs cosmology for luminosity distance.
--  5000 / 400 fibers are on sky. 
--  Sky line intensity raises Poisson error, harder to determine if there was a cosmic ray.
--  3 sigma if its a line and seven sigma to know it's a doublet (at e.g. 95% confidence).
--  see astropy fits header; fits info.
--  healpix cone lookup, where? tile to what? 
--  variation in tile depth gives non-trivial depth function in overlap regions.
--  DC17b: moniker for simulation
--  'Bright star mask': two flags, one indicates too bad to be targeted;  second flag: it might be biased but we ignored it. 
--  David Kirkby: DC17b; Data challenge coordinate. 

TBD:
0)      Params file(s):  to see what was considered; 
i)      Cosmology?  Consistent between log mock and analysis?  Chosen from Planck likelihood chain? eh, what; Sanchez + Kirkby. 
ii)     True answer for initial conditions? 
iv)     Imaging conditions?  Talk to Ellie.  
iv.5)   Imaging mask. e.g bright stars.  Not available/applied to sim currently; Adam Myers. 
iv7.5)  What is per target seed in truth; 
v)      How modular is the code, is it possible to rerun isolated effects.
vi)     Can we run on randoms?  Including anything stable, e.g. dust maps, fibers, etc.
vii)    add mock id / target id / healpix to input cats?
viii)   HPXPIXEL -> nside in name -> ringed (nested)? 64; around sq. deg; tile -> nested. 
ix)     what is TRANSPARENCY in exposures?  Photometric / clouds in the sky; Exposure time calculator. Fixed depth for ref. object elg. 
x)      MJD in exposures?  Modified Julien Date;  Day of the observation.
xi)     XFOCAL_DESIGN: mm? flat / curved?
xiii)   what is SUBPRIORITY?  ELGs, QSos, LRGS. randoms.  
xiv)    Should I believe any conclusions on priority from lognormal?  One month of DESI data could be n-body?
xv)     What is MOCKID in targets truth? row number, yes.
xvi)    OBSCONDITIONS: what is the numbering?  Conditions under which are allowed to observe object. 
xvi.5)  What sample should be the 'cleanest', e.g. brightest objects at centre of focal plane, low dust regions, good seeing, low airmass. 	
xvii)   Why not run of BOSS Nbody mocks rather than lognormal (for one month).

xvii)   All zero:  exponential / disk?  Don't simulate size.
